Health clubs, also called fitness centers or gyms, offer various services to help members meet their fitness goals. Increasing your physical activity helps prevent cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, among other common health hazards. Health clubs are an effective way to add variety to your routine. However, you do not have to go to a gym to stay active. When considering a health club, it is important that the features are worth the price you pay.

The ultimate goal of a gym is to help make its members healthier. Some health clubs require that new members undergo a health assessment. You will be weighed and a staff member will measure your body fat composition. These tests should not replace a proper wellness examination from your doctor. You should also consult your doctor before joining a health club, particularly if you are new to exercise.
